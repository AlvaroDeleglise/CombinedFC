        Erdos_Renyi(n, p, m, directed=False, loops=False)
        Generates a graph based on the Erdos-Renyi model.
        Parameters:
        n - the number of vertices.
        p - the probability of edges. If given, m must be missing. 
        m - the number of edges. If given, p must be missing. #Use this parameter in this application

        loops - whether self-loops are allowed.

        Static_Power_Law(n, m, exponent_out, exponent_in, loops=False, multiple=False, finite_size_correction=True)
        Generates a non-growing graph with prescribed power-law degree distributions.
        Parameters:
        n - the number of vertices in the graph
        m - the number of edges in the graph
        exponent_out - the exponent of the out-degree distribution, which must be between 2 and infinity (inclusive). When exponent_in is not given or negative, the graph will be undirected and this parameter specifies the degree distribution. exponent is an alias to this keyword argument.
        exponent_in - the exponent of the in-degree distribution, which must be between 2 and infinity (inclusive) It can also be negative, in which case an undirected graph will be generated.
        loops - whether loop edges are allowed.
        multiple - whether multiple edges are allowed.
        finite_size_correction - whether to apply a finite-size correction to the generated fitness values for exponents less than 3. See the paper of Cho et al for more details.
